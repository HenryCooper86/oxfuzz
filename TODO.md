# hobot_fuzz -- TODO

Status legend: [x] done - [~] partial - [ ] not started.

## Phase 1: Foundation

- [x] hf-core: `FuzzEngine`, `TargetCandidate`, `Harness`, `Crash`, `Corpus` traits.
- [~] hf-provider: LLM provider pool with multi-provider backends (OpenAI,
  Azure, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama). Freeze/thaw failover + error classification
  ported from y-agent (rate-limit/auth/5xx no longer kills a campaign). Token
  streaming not yet ported.
- [x] hf-storage: SQLite schema for runs, targets, harnesses, crashes, corpora.
- [x] hf-runtime: Docker sandbox adapter for isolated builds and fuzz runs.
- [x] hf-cli: `init`, `discover`, `harness`, `run`, `triage` subcommands (a thin
  layer over the shared `hf-service::ServiceContainer`).

## Phase 2: Discovery & Harness

- [x] hf-discovery: project scanner for C/C++ (Tree-sitter) + lexical Rust
  scanner. Go/Python scanners not yet implemented.
- [x] hf-harness: Rust cargo-fuzz backend (`cargo_fuzz` module: project
  scaffold + `cargo fuzz build`; language-aware `build_command`; `try_compile`
  Rust branch stages the crate via `copy_project_sources` and produces a
  libFuzzer binary the existing run path drives). Sandbox image gains a
  persistent nightly + cargo-fuzz toolchain. Not yet E2E-verified in-sandbox
  (needs the rebuilt image + a real cargo crate).
- [x] hf-discovery: target ranking (fit score, input surface, complexity).
- [x] hf-harness: LLM-driven harness generation with compile validation.
- [x] hf-harness: smoke fuzz step (60s) before promoting a harness.

## Phase 3: Engine Integration

- [x] hf-engine: AFL++ adapter.
- [x] hf-engine: honggfuzz adapter.
- [x] hf-engine: libFuzzer adapter.
- [x] hf-engine: ClusterFuzzLite + Syzkaller adapters.

## Phase 4: Crash & Corpus

- [x] hf-crash: crash ingestion, stack-signature dedup.
- [x] hf-crash: minimization + LLM bug-report drafting (wired into triage).
- [x] hf-corpus: seed, grow, prune, merge operations.
- [x] hf-corpus: coverage-guided minimization (cmin) + crash-to-corpus
  feedback loop (`absorb`); CLI `corpus --op minimize|absorb`.
- [x] hf-coverage: coverage delta tracking and stagnation alerts.
- [x] hf-coverage: line/region/function coverage summary (`CoverageSummary`
  from `llvm-cov export` totals); CLI `coverage`.
- [x] hf-service: detailed Markdown campaign report (`report::render_markdown`
  + `ServiceContainer::generate_report`) aggregating target, run, coverage,
  corpus, and triaged crashes (CASR severity + bug reports). Surfaced via CLI
  `report --out`, hf-web `POST /report`, and a GUI Triage "Download Report"
  button (native save dialog; browser download in web mode).
- [x] hf-service: AI-composed professional report -- the deterministic
  graph-bearing fact-sheet (Mermaid severity/kind pies + coverage chart +
  Unicode bars) is fed to the LLM, which writes the narrative (exec summary,
  methodology, per-finding impact + remediation, risk, recommendations) with
  strict fact-grounding; falls back to the fact-sheet without a provider.
- [x] hf-gui: report preview pane (react-markdown + mermaid) with rendered
  graphs, Copy/Download; "View Report" in Triage; lazy-loaded chunk.

## Phase 5: Orchestration, Safety & Polish

- [x] hf-service: single `ServiceContainer` spine; CLI/web/GUI route through
  `bootstrap()`; persists runs/targets/crashes via hf-storage.
- [x] hf-guardrails: action risk tiers, policy, HITL approval gates; enforced at
  every untrusted-execution point (compile/run/triage). Safe-by-default
  (`from_env` -> env-gated; `HF_GUARDRAILS=permissive` opts out). 4-pattern
  loop-detection guard (`loop_guard`) ported from y-agent + wired into the agent.
- [x] hf-agent: autonomous reason/act loop dispatching the fuzzing tools.
- [x] hf-gui: chat wired to the streaming agent (`chat_agent` + `chat:event`).
- [x] hf-web: REST API + SSE for run progress.
- [x] hf-engine: real `EngineAdapter` trait + registry (dead `FuzzEngine`
  removed).
- [x] hf-cli `init`: scaffolds config from templates + creates/migrates the DB.
- [x] hf-session + hf-context: persistent conversations + token-budget assembly;
  agent trims history and persists turns server-side (GUI `create_session`).
- [x] Interactive HITL dialog in the GUI (`chat:permission_request` ->
  approve/deny -> `chat_answer_permission`); chat runs under the
  approval-required guardrail policy.
- [ ] Provider token streaming: implement OpenAI SSE in `hf-provider` +
  `ProviderPool::stream` + agent Token events. (Deferred: low value through the
  ReAct JSON tool-protocol loop; would benefit from a native function-calling
  redesign first.)
- [x] Run cancellation: cooperative cancel of an in-flight `run_fuzzer` via a
  `CancellationToken` threaded through `hf-runtime`/`EngineRunner`;
  `ServiceContainer::cancel_run`/`cancel_all_runs`/`active_run_ids`; CLI Ctrl-C;
  `RunStatus::Cancelled`; GUI Stop button (`cancel_run` Tauri command +
  RunView). syzkaller (separate streaming path) not yet cancellable.
- [x] Diagnostics/Observability panels: LLM calls flow through
  `LlmProviderBridge` -> `DiagnosticsRecorder`, aggregated by
  `ServiceContainer::cost_summary` and surfaced via the `diagnostics_cost_summary`
  command; the DiagnosticsPanel renders real per-model cost/usage.
- [ ] Agents/Skills/Knowledge GUI views: back with real data (needs `hf-skills`
  command surface; `hf-knowledge` + sub-agent pools are still scaffolds).
- [ ] Remaining scaffold crates: hf-bot, hf-mcp, hf-scheduler, hf-knowledge,
  hf-skills (thin), hf-hooks, hf-journal, hf-tools (skeleton), hf-test-utils.

## Cross-cutting

- [~] CI: cargo fmt/clippy gates pass workspace-wide; add cargo-deny + test job.
- [~] Tests: storage, service, guardrails, agent covered; expand crash/triage
  and end-to-end coverage.
